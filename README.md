# Insulin Hero
> This project is a diabetic aid application, designed to help users better keep track of and manage their diabetes as either a type 1, type 2 or prediabetic individual. *
*This project was my final capstone at Tech Elevator. The project had a development time limit of two-weeks.*
<!-- > Live demo [_here_](https://www.example.com).  If you have the project hosted somewhere, include the link here. -->

Diabetes is an affliction that has profoundly negative impacts on many people around the world. The goal of this project was to produce an application that would help individuals who have prediabetic blood sugar levels or type1/2 diabetes manage their condition easier.

## General Information
- **Problem:** There are many applications for individuals to track diabetes and blood sugar from, but very few that are free, user-friendly, and simplified to exclusively the feature sets that have been defined as helpful by the community.
- **Purpose:**  The purpose of this application is to help these users track their blood sugar levels and gain predictions about where their blood sugar will be in the future, gain guidance on what they should be eating to more effectively manage their blood sugar based on glycemic load, and obtain new calculated doses of insulin in a simplified format.

## Room for Improvement
_Areas for improvement_

The two week time limit was a difficult constraint. As such, there are many more areas of improvement than the following, but a few major ones are:

- Performance enhancements server side/ less sequential api calls.
- Better styling and client side organization.
- ML algorithm accuracy tweaks.
- General code cleaning.
